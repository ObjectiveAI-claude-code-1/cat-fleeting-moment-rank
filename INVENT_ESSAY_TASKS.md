1. Evaluate the action transience of each photograph by examining whether the cat's body is captured between states — in a physical configuration that is inherently unstable and passing. Look for bodies suspended mid-leap, mouths open at the peak of a yawn, paws striking at a toy, legs compressing on landing, or the slow collapse from wakefulness into sleep. Determine whether the cat occupies a posture that cannot be held and can only be passed through, or whether the body is at rest in an equilibrium that could persist unchanged for minutes. A cat frozen in the arc of a jump is in transit; a cat sitting upright on a cushion is in a condition. Rank the photograph higher when the body is clearly between one state and the next, and lower when it has settled into a durable, stable pose with no sense of physical motion or transition.

2. Evaluate the expressive singularity of each photograph by examining whether the cat's face and body display a fleeting micro-expression or sensory reaction that is specific to that precise instant. Look for eyes caught at the midpoint of a slow blink, a squint against a sudden change in light, ears rotated backward at a half-heard sound, whiskers briefly flattened during a sniff, or the wide round-eyed stare of sudden alertness that will soften a heartbeat later. Determine whether the configuration of ears, eyes, whiskers, and facial posture reveals something happening inside the cat at that exact moment — an emotional or sensory flicker that will vanish in a fraction of a second — or whether the expression is neutral, relaxed, and indistinguishable from how the cat would look at any other point in time. Rank the photograph higher when it feels like a portrait of a specific psychological instant, and lower when it reads as a generic document of what the cat generally looks like.

3. Evaluate the temporal urgency of each photograph by judging the overall sensation that the image was lucky — that a narrow window opened between the cat's unpredictability and the camera's timing, and was seized before it closed. Consider not only the cat's action and expression but also its relationship to the environment in that instant: a shaft of light about to shift, a shadow whose geometry depends on a posture about to change, or a sense of narrative imminence where something is clearly about to happen or has just happened. Determine whether the photograph sits on the edge of a story or in the middle of a stillness, and whether the viewer would feel that this image almost did not get captured. Rank the photograph higher when the entire scene radiates the feeling of an unrepeatable, one-time event — a convergence of chance and attention that could not have been planned or posed — and lower when the scene would look essentially identical at any other point across a longer stretch of time.
